# NixOS Configuration

My NixOS configuration files, this also includes:

* A Neovim configuration totally not stolen from someone on the internet
* Some i3wm configuration done through nix itself with some (soon to be automated) pywal

## How to use it?

<TODO>

## Why should I use it?

You probably shouldn't.
